# Rust_Servers
Implementations of single and multithreaded webservers as the final project from Chapter 20 of 'The Rust Programming Language'

## * Disclaimer *
> "Before we get started, we should mention one detail: the method we’ll use won’t be the best way to build a web server with Rust. Community members have published a number of production-ready crates available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) that provide more complete web server and thread pool implementations than we’ll build. However, our intention in this chapter is to help you learn, not to take the easy route. Because Rust is a systems programming language, we can choose the level of abstraction we want to work with and can go to a lower level than is possible or practical in other languages. We’ll therefore write the basic HTTP server and thread pool manually so you can learn the general ideas and techniques behind the crates you might use in the future."

The code in this Repository is entirely based on the examples provided in 'The Rust Programming Language', Chapter 20. Deviations from the source code in control flow structure and variable usage, in addition to comment explanations, are present to show that this project was hand-typed, and to demonstrate comprehension of the written material.
